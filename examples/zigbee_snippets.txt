# Zigbee: wireless protocol, not a programming language
# Logic would be implemented in embedded C or vendor-specific scripting
# Placeholder to represent Zigbee device logic:
# - Set x, v, m, dm_dt
# - Compute p = m * v
# - Compute NKTg1 = x * p
# - Compute NKTg2 = dm_dt * p
# - Transmit values over Zigbee network
