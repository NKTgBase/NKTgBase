# SPARQL: query language for RDF data
# SPARQL is not designed for arithmetic, but conceptually:
# SELECT ?p ?NKTg1 ?NKTg2 WHERE {
#   BIND(2.0 AS ?x)
#   BIND(3.0 AS ?v)
#   BIND(5.0 AS ?m)
#   BIND(0.1 AS ?dm_dt)
#   BIND(?m * ?v AS ?p)
#   BIND(?x * ?p AS ?NKTg1)
#   BIND(?dm_dt * ?p AS ?NKTg2)
# }
