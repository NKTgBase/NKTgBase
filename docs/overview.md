# The NKTg Law of Varying Inertia

The NKTg Law describes the tendency of an object to move based on its position (x), velocity (v), mass (m), and the rate of mass variation (dm/dt).

- **NKTg₁ = x × p**
- **NKTg₂ = (dm/dt) × p**
- Where: p = m × v

Interpretation:
- NKTg₁ > 0 → the object tends to leave its stable state
- NKTg₂ > 0 → mass variation contributes to motion

Unit of measurement: **NKTm**
