# üìò Overview of the NKTg Law

The NKTg Law of Varying Inertia describes how an object's tendency to move in space depends on the relationship between its position, velocity, and mass.

## üî¢ Core Equation

**NKTg = f(x, v, m)**

Where:
- **x**: Position or displacement relative to a reference point
- **v**: Velocity
- **m**: Mass

## ‚öõÔ∏è Derived Quantities

From this relationship, two key quantities are defined:

- **p = m √ó v** ‚Üí Linear momentum
- **NKTg‚ÇÅ = x √ó p** ‚Üí Position-momentum product
- **NKTg‚ÇÇ = (dm/dt) √ó p** ‚Üí Mass-variation-momentum product

Where:
- **dm/dt**: Rate of mass change over time
- **NKTg‚ÇÅ**: Represents the influence of position on motion
- **NKTg‚ÇÇ**: Represents the influence of mass variation on motion
- **NKTm**: Unit of measurement for varying inertia

## üìà Interpretation

- If **NKTg‚ÇÅ > 0**, the object tends to move away from a stable state.
- If **NKTg‚ÇÅ < 0**, the object tends to return toward a stable state.
- If **NKTg‚ÇÇ > 0**, mass variation supports the motion.
- If **NKTg‚ÇÇ < 0**, mass variation resists the motion.

## üßò Stability Definition

In the context of the NKTg Law, a stable state is defined as a condition where position (**x**), velocity (**v**), and mass (**m**) interact to preserve the object's movement structure‚Äîhelping it avoid losing control and maintain its inherent motion pattern.
