# NKTgLaw System Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the NKTgLaw project, which models the NKTg Law on Varying Inertia ‚Äî a physical framework proposed by Nguy·ªÖn Kh√°nh T√πng.

## üìê Conceptual Foundation

The NKTg Law defines the movement tendency of an object based on its position (x), velocity (v), and mass (m):

**NKTg = f(x, v, m)**

From this, two derived quantities are computed:

- **NKTg‚ÇÅ = x √ó p**  
- **NKTg‚ÇÇ = (dm/dt) √ó p**

Where:
- **p = m √ó v** is the linear momentum
- **dm/dt** is the rate of mass change
- The unit of measurement is **NKTm**

These quantities help determine whether an object is stabilizing or destabilizing in motion.

## üß© System Components

### 1. Core Library (`core/`)
- Written in **C++**, **Rust**, and **Go**
- Implements core calculations: `momentum`, `computeNKTg1`, `computeNKTg2`
- Header-only design for easy integration

### 2. API Layer (`api/`, `server/`)
- Provides **REST** and **gRPC** interfaces
- Enables remote computation and client-server interaction
- Built with Python (FastAPI) and OpenAPI spec

### 3. Clients (`clients/`)
- Contains wrappers for multiple languages
- Supports quick testing and integration
- Example: Python, C++, Q#, etc.

### 4. Examples (`examples/`)
- 150+ standalone implementations across diverse languages
- Each file demonstrates:
  - `p = m * v`
  - `NKTg‚ÇÅ = x * p`
  - `NKTg‚ÇÇ = (dm/dt) * p`
- Default parameters: `x=2`, `v=3`, `m=5`, `dm_dt=0.1`

### 5. Foundations (`foundations/`)
- Theoretical documents and experimental data
- Includes:
  - `wiki.md`, `index.md`
  - NASA planetary data
  - NKTm unit definition

### 6. Benchmarks & Tools
- `benchmarks/`: Performance tests (e.g., Q# benchmarks)
- `tools/`: Developer utilities (e.g., linting scripts)
