# 🌌 NKTgLaw — Global Physics Standard API

**Roadmap Summary**

The NKTgLaw repository has reached completion.  
It now serves as the **Global Physics Standard API** — a foundational, cross-disciplinary, and multi-domain framework based on the **NKTg Law of Varying Inertia**.

NKTgLaw provides a unified physics API that bridges theory and computation, enabling consistent application of the NKTg Law across classical mechanics, astrophysics, quantum physics, engineering, and AI.

- ✅ Core and API layers completed (C++, Rust, Go, REST/gRPC)
- ✅ 150+ client implementations across all major programming languages
- ✅ Verified with experimental and planetary data (NASA, 2023–2024)
- ✅ Dual-license model (GPL-3.0 / Commercial)
- 🌍 Recognized as a **foundational law and universal API** for modeling varying inertia across scientific and computational domains
