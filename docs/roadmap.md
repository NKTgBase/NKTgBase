# 🗺️ NKTgLaw Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned milestones, features, and improvements for the NKTgLaw system. It is designed to guide contributors and users through the evolution of the project.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Implementation (Completed)

- [x] Define NKTg Law equations: NKTg₁ = x × p, NKTg₂ = (dm/dt) × p
- [x] Implement core functions in C++ (`nktg.hpp`)
- [x] Create multi-language examples (150+ implementations)
- [x] Set up documentation structure (`docs/`)
- [x] Publish initial README and licensing model

---

## 🚧 Phase 2: API & Client Integration (In Progress)

- [ ] Finalize REST and gRPC API endpoints (`api/`, `server/`)
- [ ] Expand client wrappers for Python, Q#, Rust, Go
- [ ] Add authentication and rate-limiting to API
- [ ] Create interactive web demo for NKTg calculations

---

## 🔬 Phase 3: Scientific Expansion

- [ ] Integrate symbolic computation (e.g., SymPy, Wolfram)
- [ ] Add support for relativistic mechanics
- [ ] Develop unit-aware computation engine
- [ ] Validate NKTg Law with planetary datasets (NASA, ESA)

---

## 📊 Phase 4: Visualization & UI

- [ ] Build visual dashboard for NKTg₁ and NKTg₂ trends
- [ ] Add dynamic plotting of position, momentum, and mass variation
- [ ] Create educational animations explaining NKTg Law

---

## 🌐 Phase 5: Community & Collaboration

- [ ] Launch discussion forum and Q&A section
- [ ] Publish contributor guide and code of conduct
- [ ] Translate documentation into multiple languages
- [ ] Host workshops and webinars on NKTg Law

---

## 📦 Long-Term Goals

- [ ] Publish peer-reviewed paper on NKTg Law
- [ ] Package SDK for integration into physics engines
- [ ] Release mobile app for NKTg simulation
- [ ] Explore AI-assisted modeling of varying inertia
